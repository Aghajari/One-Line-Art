Have you heard anything about **The Art of One Line Drawing** Or **Single Line Drawing** Or maybe **Continuous Line Drawing**?

From [The art of one line drawings](https://medium.com/@michellegemmeke/the-art-of-one-line-drawings-8cd8fd5a5af7) :
> A one line drawing, also known as a single line drawing, is a drawing made with just one single, unbroken line.
> The most famous example even dates back to the early 20th century, the one line drawings made by Pablo Picasso. He took a complex, realistic example and simplified it into one single unbroken line. These drawings can look relatively simple to make, but capturing the true essence of the shape in just one line can be quite challenging.

Ain't It Fantastic? 😍 <br>
Just as we can draw any simple and complex drawing with one line, we can also implement different algorithms with just one line of code. Obviously, this is not a coding style, but it is clear that creating an algorithm in one line can be very challenging. Therefore, I'm saying that this is literally an art and not everyone can do it!  

**Python** is one of the best choices to do this. You will soon understand why :)<br>
I will give you some basic ideas on how to do this, then we will share different questions with each other and try to solve it with a single line of code. It's gonna be very fun and challenging, believe me 😃
